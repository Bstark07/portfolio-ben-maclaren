<p>It's that time of year again! Canberras largest entrepreneural program
  Innovation ACT (iACT) brings together likeminded idea driven entrepreneurs
  from around Canberra every year.</p>

<p>This year I was lucky to be able to join a committee of iACT alumnis
   to help budding businesses going through the iACT program</p>

<p>As a Alumni I attended the iACT business development workshops as mentors
to give advice and aid entreprenurs as they grow there idea/startup throughout
the program</p>

<p>There was a aamzing range of budding start-ups this year, it was a great experience to
be able to offer my expertise and skills to help educate and guide Canberras
growing community of entreprenurs.</p>

<p>For now iACT 2018 is finished, here's to keep a eye out for iACT 2019.
A wonderful thanks to the crew at Mude for their amazing photography work,
my fellow iACT Alumni members for taking the time to volunteer and to the
incredible staff that run iACT every year spending their precious weekends.</p>
