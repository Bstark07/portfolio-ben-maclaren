<p><i>"We often get glimpses of incredible advances in health on the news,
  but too often never hear about them again," - Marcus Dawe, CEO of Health Horizon.</i></p>

I've been working for the past few months with <a href="https://thehealthhorizon.com">Health Horizons</a>
a health innovation company that idenitfies catalogues and tracks health innovations
around the world.  This allows people, medical practicioners and hospitals to
follow and keep up to date with health innovations that are important to them.

<h3>1. Article: Three Games Changing How We See Autism</h3>

<p>My first piece of work was a article for their medium blog, after browsing
through the health horizons database I settled on three games that help raise awareness
for autism.</p>

<p>This is a topic close to me, most members of my family and alot of
my friends are autistic, there are alot of different struggles they all face,
hopefully these games will help others connect with them and aid in understanding
others whose experiences are different from our own.</p>

<h3>2. Australia Chloropleth</h3>

<p>Analysing and visualising data is all good and everything; but if we don't
put that insight to use, then it goes to waste.</p>
<p>After Analysing and experimenting with data and combining graphic design
with generated graphs, I made a Chloropleth illustrating distribution of
health innovations in Australia</p>

<h3>3. Experimental visualisations</h3>

{% include gallery caption="A sample of experimental visualisations" %}

<h3>4. Data Analysis</h3>
<p>Health Horizon maintains a database of over 800 Health innovations but had
  not done any visualisations of their dataset. Visualising a data set and
  experimenting with data can allow a business especially in the data
  industry to gain insights into different potential avenues of communications
  and perspectives.</p>
<p>This stage mostly involved cleaning data that was kindly provided to menu
by HH, unfortunately due to security and privacy I can't share any of the data
on here</p>
