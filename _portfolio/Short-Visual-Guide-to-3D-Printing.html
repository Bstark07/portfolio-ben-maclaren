<p>In the early days of mainstream 3D Printing, I ran educational workshops as part of the
<a href="/portfolio/ANU-Maker-Club.html">ANU Maker Club</a> and consulted
on 3D Printing systems for business as part of my own business called
<a href="#">3DForge</a>.</p>

<p>I had accumulated a wealth of information and experience regarding 3D Printing
and teaching, Over the course of a month I setout and completed:
"A Short Illustrated Guide to 3D Printing".</p>


{%include gallery style="center"%}

<p>The main goal of this guide was:
  <ul>
    <li>Content easy to understand, comprehensive yet short</li>
    <li>Useful to both newcomers to 3D Printing and seasoned users</li>
    <li> Contain real world examples small and large</li>
    <li>Provide links and information for further learning</li>
    <li>Cater to audiences as young as high-school age.</li>
  </ul>

<p>
  The final result is a 41 page visually pleasing guide freely available to anyone
  and satisfying all 5 of the desired goals.
</p>

<p>It has been distributed by a few local teachers to students and used by the local
  community.</p>
