It's time I'm graduated from a infrequent [personal blog](https://benjdmaclaren.wordpress.com/) to a more professional portfolio website.

After many browsing and testing, I settled on the Jykkl website static website
generator. It's a perfect blend of technical and non technical experience.

Static websites are sites that don't run any server side code/databases. They
have a number of advantages when it comes to portfolio and general websites.

- Speed: Since the pages are just straight up html/CSS/JS they load fast as lighting.
- Flexibility: Since every site is coded in html/CSS/JS a well versed web designer ;) can design with more freedom than a dynamic site.
- Cheap hosting.
- Extra bonus: Using a static website generator, adding content is fairly easy.

### Development Process

Over the course of 2 days I developed this site along with the pages of work that
are in the work page.

There was a few fun learning curves, such as never having used Jekyll or markdown
before. However now I've become quite familiar with both and am currently
designing a custom theme for this site as well as a site for some other people.
