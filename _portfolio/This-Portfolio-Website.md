I've been doing a lot of stuff lately ... the iACT Alumni Committee, my Internship
at Health Horizons, the various little projects that always seem to be happening,
It's time I'm graduating from a infrequent [personal blog](https://benjdmaclaren.wordpress.com/) to a more professional
portfolio website.

After many browsing and testing, I settled on the Jykkl website static website
generator. It's a perfect blend of technical and non technical experience.

Static websites are sites that don't run any server side code/databases. They
have a number of advantages when it comes to portfolio and general websites.

- Speed: Since the pages are just straight up html/CSS/JS they load fast as lighting.
- Flexibility: Since every site is coded in html/CSS/JS a well versed web designer can design with more freedom than a dynamic sites.
- Cheap Hosting.
- Extra Bonus: If your using a static website generator, adding content is fairly easy.

### Development Process

Like most projects, the first thing I do is open up a graphic design program and
do a few rough drafts.

Over the course of 2 days I developed this site along with the pages of work that
are in the work page. There was a few fun learning curves, such as never having used
Jekyll or markdown before. However now I've become quite familiar with both and am
currently designing a custom theme for this site as well as a site for some other people.
