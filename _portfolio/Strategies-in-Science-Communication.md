"A week of intensive workshops and I have completed a short course in
"Strategies in Science Communication" a ANU course and public available short course in techniques for developing communication strategies run by the lovely Lawrence Kirk.

This course is currently in progress, a desktop review of a Canberra based organisation
has been undertaken and a detailed report is being written, due to privacy I'm unable
to show the current work on here now, however I hope to get permission to showcase
some pages after October.

### Desk Review

The main piece of work for this course is doing a desk review of a organisation.
A desk view is a starting point to developing a communications strategy, it analyses
a organisations public face, looking at its communication channels and extracts
from them perceived key messages, quantifies communication channels and offers
recommendations and insights.

A desk review is useful, as it allows you to see how your communication partners
see your organisation, this can help see new opportunities or issues that might be
occurring.
